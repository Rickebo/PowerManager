## Introduction

PowerManager is a simple .NET 6 application to automatically change Windows power plans depending on some circumstances.
Currently, the application can change power plans if certain processes defined in the settings.json file are
running or not.

## My use case

I decided to write this application so that I could use the high-performance power plan only when some applications are running.
